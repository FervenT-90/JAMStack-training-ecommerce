### Create an E-Commerce App with Gatsby and **@tpiros**

Where to _**enroll this free course**_ and get more information about it [**here**](https://jamstack.training/p/create-an-e-commerce-app-with-gatsby). Information about [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and his **_hello world [starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world)_**

Most of **the details about what is done** in each chapter are specified in the **commits**. 

:point_up: **One of the reasons** I explain the details of the steps from the project **in commits** and **don't in README.md** file it's because I'm **trying to involve** the people who are interested in **any project**, reading the commits, checking what is done and how, and **why not**, **learning** or **share some improvements** with the **committer**.

:thought_balloon: **I Think** it's a good idea to **share knowledge constructively**, getting knowledge and **giving aswell**. Don't forget **"hakunamatata"** *"Vive y deja vivir"* :v:

:chart_with_upwards_trend: *You will be able to realize that all the **commits have the same structure** and are written in a particular way. Just trying to find out **good practices** and **improve** my **Git** knowledge* 

:recycle: *Let se if we find better ways using Git that adapts to ours thoughts about how it could be better than now at least!*
